# AYLUS Volunteers - by AYLUS Irvine

Welcome! This is the repo for AYLUS Volunteers beta app instructions.

If you are just stopping by, there's no app data or sensitive information in this repo. It is merely [a page for instructions to be accessed by volunteers](https://aylusirvine.github.io/betainstructions). 

### Issues/contributing/developing the app 

If you encounter any issues, create a new request [here](https://github.com/aylusirvine/betainstructions/issues).
