# Instructions

## Important Information

### What is this?

Firstly, thank you for checking out our page. 

This page contains instructions to download the first beta release of our newly designed "AYLUS Volunteers" app for AYLUS members to check into their branch and access [webapp](https://aylus.herokuapp.com) features on their iOS devices. Android support will be available upon request, which can voiced by [creating an issue here](https://github.com/aylusirvine/betainstructions/issues). 

Our app is currently stable, designated v0.1. We are looking forward to gaining user feedback and implementing new features through our "Feedback Form" functionality inside our app. It is completely safe and only sends your AYLUS Volunteers data to process login/elevatedaccess to certain pages in our app. 

**If you frequently use a mobile device to check our events, you may find this app useful and worth it to download. It'll take 15 minutes of your time, and it'll make our time developing this app worth it. :)**

### Why is this not on the App Store or through an Apple-related beta distribution service such as [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/)?

To maintain a small-scale app like this would be no different from maintaining an app used by 1M+ people. Both are subject to review and vetted tests by Apple staff, and for something like AYLUS Volunteers this unnecessarily complicates the work we have to do. Additionally, **the Apple Developer program costs $99 every year.** Putting up with such a cost is simply not worth it, especially when we can use the money to donate or help others in our community.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Have an iOS device, self-explanatory. 10+ MB free is optimal.
- Have a Windows PC or a Mac.
- Have an Apple ID. If you normally download apps on your iPhone/iPad, you can use that account's username/password for a future step.
- Have an iPhone/iPad charger cable, and connect that to your computer through a USB port.

### Step 1: Set up AltStore ([their GitHub](https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore) has over 4.8k stars, and they are a trustworthy source.)

- Download [AltServer](https://altstore.io/) for your device. Install it and open the application.
**FOR MACS ONLY, you will need to install a Mail plug-in per the instructions here:**  
![](https://github.com/aylusirvine/betainstructions/blob/main/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-23%20at%204.11.19%20PM.png?raw=true)

- Gain trust to connect to your device by unlocking it and clicking ```Trust.```
- Using the image from **Step 1** on the AltServer website, click ```Install AltStore --> .... iPhone.``` On Mac, no actual application should show up; it should be in the top header bar.  
*It will prompt you asking to sign in. This is where your Apple ID comes in. You will need to input both your email and password into the prompt.*
- On the Home Screen of your device, you should see a new app: ```AltStore.```
- Open that app.
- **DO NOT** disconnect your device from your computer yet.

### Step 2: Download the .ipa (beta application) file from Dropbox.
- **On your mobile device (in Safari),** navigate to http://bit.ly/airvolunteers.
- Click ```Continue to Website --> Download --> Direct Download.```
- There should be a new screen popping up with the name "airNew.ipa." On the upper right, there should be an "up arrow/share" button. Click that.
- At this time, you should see a row of apps, one of them being "AltStore."
- Now with your device **still connected to the PC/Mac**, click AltStore and it will take you to the app.
- At this point, **wait a minute or so** until "Volunteers" pops up on the app menu in AltStore.
- This means the app has been installed correctly. 

### Step 3: Trust Developer Certificate

This may or may not be necessary for you. In order to test, click on the app and see if it lets you open. If it doesn't:

- Go to Settings and for iOS 14, you should see a new tab under your account something along the lines of "Developer" or "Certificate." Accept the developer certificate (should be under your Apple ID and hence your email).
- For iOS 13 and under, go to ```General --> Profiles --> Device Management``` and accept the certificate there.

## After Installation (IMPORTANT)

- Disconnect mobile from PC/Mac.
- You can leave AltStore open or quit the app. **Do not delete it, or your app will stop working after a week. AltStore refreshes the apps for you every week.**

At this point, you should be all set! Try it out and enjoy!

Writing this guide and creating the app took me a veritable amount of effort, so please consider using this app as much as you can (by registering and participating in as many events as you can). Thank you!
