# Important Information

## What is this?

Firstly, thank you for checking out our page. 

This page contains instructions to download the first beta release of our newly designed "AYLUS Volunteers" app for AYLUS members to check into their branch and access [webapp](aylus.herokuapp.com) features on their iOS devices. Android support will be coming out upon request, which can voiced by [creating an issue here](https://github.com/aylusirvine/betainstructions/issues). 

Our app is currently stable, designed v0.1. We are looking forward to gaining user feedback and implementing new features through our "Feedback Form" functionality inside our app. It is completely safe and only sends your AYLUS Volunteers data to process login/elevatedaccess to certain pages in our app. 

If you frequently use a mobile device to check our events, you may find this app useful and worth it to download. 

## Why is this not on the App Store or through an Apple-related beta distribution service such as [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/)?

To maintain a small-scale app like this would be no different from maintaining an app used by 1M+ people. Both are subject to review and vetted tests by Apple staff, and for something like AYLUS Volunteers this unnecessarily complicates the work we have to do. Additionally, **the Apple Developer program costs $99 every year.** Putting up with such a cost is simply not worth it, especially when we can use the money to donate or help others in our community.
